# DLT OpenAPI Source Generator Demos

In this repository, you will find sample pipelines generated by dlt's open API source generator. This is a demonstration to showcase how these pipelines work and how you can utilize them in your own projects.

> **Warning**
>
> The pipeline generator is on the first iteration, and we expect there can be all kind of issues with the specs or generated pipelines. 
> 
> Instead, consider it a possible starting point. You can troubleshoot it as described in the linked video.

## About

To learn more about dlt-init-openapi, an OpenAPI Source Generator for the dlt Python Library, please visit the official [dlt-init-openapi](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt-init-openapi) repo.

## Pipeline Documentation

Each pipeline folder contains its own `README.md` file that provides detailed information about the specific pipeline. These documents are intended to help you understand the functionality and setup of each pipeline.

## OpenAPI Specs

To get a list of OpenAPI specifications that are used in this repository, please visit the [dlt-hub/openapi-specs](https://github.com/dlt-hub/openapi-specs/) repository.

## Running the Pipelines

To run these pipelines, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired pipeline folder using the `cd` command:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/pipeline-folder
    ```

2. Install all requirements from the requirements.txt file. 
3. Ensure that any required API keys are added to the `secrets.toml` file located in the `.dlt` folder. This file is necessary for accessing certain APIs.

4. Execute the `..._pipeline.py` file in your CLI. Example:
    ```sh
    python game_of_thrones_pipeline.py
    ```

That's it! You should now be able to run the pipelines and see the results.
