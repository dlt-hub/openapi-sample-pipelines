In this repository, you will find sample pipelines generated by dlt's RESTAPI generator.

To get a list of openapi-specs that are in this repository, please visit https://github.com/dlt-hub/openapi-specs/.

In order to run these pipelines, all you have to do is make sure that if an api key is needed to run that specific api, that it is added to the secrets.toml in the .dlt folder, and then execute the _pipeline.py file on your CLI!
