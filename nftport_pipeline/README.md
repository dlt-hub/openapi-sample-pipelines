## Available resources
* _GET /_ 
  *resource*:   
* _GET /v0/accounts/contracts/{account_address}_ 
  *resource*: account_contracts_response  
  *description*: Returns a list of contracts (i.e. collections) based on `type` of ownership:  1. `owns_contract_nfts`- the given account (wallet) address owns at least one NFT.  2. `owns_contracts`- the given account (wallet) address is the owner of the contract.  #### Useful for: * Showing the user a list of contracts in which they own NFTs. * Showing the user a list of contracts owned by them. * Checking if a user owns an NFT in a specific collections and then unlocking some experience for them, i.e. token-gating. (You are still responsible for validating that the user owns the wallet.)  #### Related: * For a quick start, see the [List of sample addresses](../docs/About/SampleAddresses.md) to copy. * To get a list of all NFTs owned by this account, see [Retrieve NFTs owned by account](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1accounts~1{account_address}/get). * To get extra detailed information on the returned NFTs, see [Retrieve NFT details](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1nfts~1{contract_address}~1{token_id}/get).
* _GET /v0/accounts/{account_address}_ 
  *resource*: account_nfts_response  
  *description*: Returns NFTs owned by a given account (i.e. wallet) address. Can also return each NFT metadata with  ```include```  parameter.  #### Useful for: * For checking if a user owns a specific NFT and then unlocking specific activity. * Adding NFT portfolio section to your apps.  #### Related: * For a quick start, see the [List of sample addresses](../docs/About/SampleAddresses.md) to copy. * To get all NFTs per contract, see [Retrieve contract NFTs](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1nfts~1{contract_address}/get). * To get extra detailed information on the returned NFTs, see [Retrieve NFT details](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1nfts~1{contract_address}~1{token_id}/get).
* _GET /v0/transactions/stats/{contract_address}_ 
  *resource*: collection_stats_response  
  *description*: Retrieve in-depth sales statistics about a contract from OpenSea. Includes statistics such as floor price, total volume, sales, etc. Updated with 1-hour interval.  #### Useful for: * Analysis and ranking of NFT collections. * Tracking NFT collections by sales, etc.  #### Related: * For a quick start, see the [List of sample addresses](../docs/About/SampleAddresses.md) to copy. * To query transactions from a contract, see [Retrieve transactions by contract](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1transactions~1nfts~1{contract_address}/get). * To get all NFTs of a contract, see [Retrieve contract NFTs](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1nfts~1{contract_address}/get).
* _GET /v0/nfts/{contract_address}_ 
  *resource*: contract_nft  
  *description*: Returns all NFTs for a given contract address. Can be set to ```include``` the NFT ```metadata```, ```file_information```, ```rarity```, ```last_sale_price``` or ```all``` which returns extra information. Ethereum, Polygon and Goerli are supported.  #### Useful for: * Importing all NFTs from a given contract to your application.  #### Related: * For a quick start, see the [List of sample addresses](../docs/About/SampleAddresses.md) to copy. * To get detailed information on the returned NFTs, see [Retrieve NFT details](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1nfts~1{contract_address}~1{token_id}/get). * To get NFTs that a given account owns, see [Retrieve NFTs owned by an account](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1accounts~1{account_address}/get).
* _GET /v0/mints/batch/{transaction_hash}_ 
  *resource*: get_batch_minted_nft_response  
  *description*: Returns the details of a batch minted NFTs for ERC1155 contracts. You need to provide  ```transaction_hash```  which is returned from [Batch customizable minting](../3.json/paths/~1v0~1mints~1customizable~1batch/post). Minting is not instantaneous because blockchains take time to verify transactions. Thus, you can poll this endpoint every 5 seconds until you get a response.  #### Useful for: * Confirming that NFT minting was successful and the NFTs are on chain.  #### Related: * For batch customizable minting, see [Batch customizable minting](../3.json/paths/~1v0~1mints~1customizable~1batch/post).
* _GET /v0/contracts/{transaction_hash}_ 
  *resource*: get_deployed_contract_response  
  *description*: Returns the details of a contract that has previously been deployed with [Deploy a contract for NFT products](../3.json/paths/~1v0~1contracts/post) or [Deploy an NFT collection contract](../3.json/paths/~1v0~1contracts~1collections/post). Supply the ```transaction_hash``` to check if the contract is on chain and to get the ```contract_address```. For NFT product contracts, you can use the returned ```contract_address``` in [Customizable Minting](../3.json/paths/~1v0~1mints~1customizable/post).  As blockchains can take a few seconds up to a few minutes to sync, this endpoint can be polled until the ```contract_address``` is returned.  #### Useful for: * Deploying your own contracts so you can build custom products or collections easily.  #### Related: * If you want to get data about NFT contracts which you haven't deployed using NFTPort, see [Retrieve contract NFTs](../1.json/paths/~1v0~1nfts~1{contract_address}/get). * If you want to learn how to use the [customizable minting](../3.json/paths/~1v0~1mints~1customizable/post), see [Customizable Minting Quickstart](docs/minting/Minting-Quickstart.md#customizable-minting).
